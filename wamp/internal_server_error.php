Check that you have the the apache rewrite module loaded.

go to wamp_manager -> apache -> modules and look for rewrite_module in the list.

If it does not have a TICK beside it click it. Apache will be bounced ( stop, start ). Try again.

The rewite engine will not work without the required module loaded.
